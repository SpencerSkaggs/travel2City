# travelLogger

## Inspiration
We were inspired on the basis of the complexity of traveling. In order to book a trip, you have to spend countless hours on multiple sites trying to get all the pieces in place. We wanted to design a site that puts all of the necessary components in one easy to use, convenient location.
## What it does
Our website, Travel2City, allows users a friendly experience with traveling. It asks users to create an account and then asks for a destination city. It tells users the temperature, wind speeds, and forecast predictions for the city they are desiring to travel. It has another area that you can find popular exchange rates for currencies, a much needed feature if you are traveling out of the country.
## How we built it
We used Github to create a repository that houses HTML, CSS, and JS documents. We used VSCode to implement these documents and then used API's to find the information needed to complete our site.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few challenges, the main one being finding the right API's for the website. It was challenging to find ones that had the necessary information without having to pay for one, since our website is not funded.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the overall usability of the site. It is in its beginning stages at the moment, but it is fully functional, and has a lot of potential for future modifications and additions.
## What we learned
We learned that splitting up work and dividing and conquering is key to success in a big project such as this. It made solving problems much easier and we were able to get everything accomplished.
## What's next for Travel2City
In the future, we would like to add on more API's and more things the user can find for their trip. For example, flight prices and times would be a great addition, along with expected travel time for the whole trip.
